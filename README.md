# pandas-challenge

This repository will be used to turn in the module 4: pandas challenge homework.

Both the code and written report files can be found in the /PyCitySchools directory. The code for the homework is named PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb and the written report is under writtenreport.txt

For this challenge we were provided with a district-wide standardized test results, which includes every students math and reading scores. The given files was aggregated into one data set in which each individual row provided the individual student's id, name, gender, grade, school attended, math score, reading score, and their school's ID, type, size, and budget.

We used the pandas module and ran the code through jupyter lab.

For this challenge I used class activities, class materials, and coding forums, to a lesser extent, for the majority of the coding.

ChatGPT was used to troubleshoot the code.

The challenge was fairly straightforward and really exhibited how strong of a tool Pandas is for data analysis. I will definitely be using this in the future.
