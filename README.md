# pandas-challenge
Repository will be used to turn in module 4 homework for pandas-challenge.

This submission will not be my final submission of the homework. I will continue to work through the problem and submit an updated hw assignment.

The code can be found under "PyCitySchools_starter.ipnyb"

As of now, my inputs into the code have come purely from class activities and no other sources.
